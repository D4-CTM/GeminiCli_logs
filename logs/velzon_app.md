* model:
	- Got it. Thanks for the context!

* user:
	- I need your help to prototype a project that uses the next:
- Velzon - Admin & Dashboard template.
- It uses Angular 18 with a modular aproach using standalone components.
- It uses ngx-transalte.
- Centralized state with NgRx.
- Graphs using Chart.js and ApexCharts.
- CKEditor as text editor.

Give me a estimation of time, which versions of the dependencies are required and a brief
explanation on how to use them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All the dependencies **MUST** be the latest version compatible with Angular 18.

Place everything in a GEMINI.md file.

* model:
	- Of course, I can help you with that. I will gather the information and create the `GEMINI.md` file for you.

First, I will search for the latest versions of the dependencies that are compatible with Angular 18.

# Project Setup: Velzon with Angular 18

This document outlines the estimated time, required dependencies, and a brief explanation of how to set up a project using the Velzon - Admin & Dashboard template with Angular 18.

## Project Setup Estimation

The estimated time to set up the project with the specified dependencies is **2-4 hours**. This includes installing the dependencies, configuring them, and integrating them into the project.

## Dependencies

All the dependencies listed below are the latest versions compatible with Angular 18.

### Velzon - Admin & Dashboard template

*   **Version:** Angular 19 (compatible with Angular 18)
*   **Explanation:** Velzon is a premium admin and dashboard template that provides a wide range of pre-built components and pages. It is built with Bootstrap 5.3.6 and is fully responsive.
*   **Usage:**
    1.  Purchase and download the Velzon template from the official website.
    2.  Follow the instructions in the documentation to set up the project.
    3.  Integrate the required components and pages into your application.

### @ngx-translate/core

*   **Version:** 16.x
*   **Explanation:** ngx-translate is a library for internationalization (i18n) in Angular. It allows you to translate your application into multiple languages.
*   **Usage:**
    1.  Install the library: `npm install @ngx-translate/core @ngx-translate/http-loader`
    2.  Import the `TranslateModule` in your `app.module.ts` and configure the `TranslateHttpLoader`.
    3.  Create JSON files for each language with the translations.
    4.  Use the `translate` pipe or the `TranslateService` to translate your content.

### @ngrx/store

*   **Version:** 18.x
*   **Explanation:** NgRx is a state management library for Angular applications, inspired by Redux. It provides a centralized store for your application's state, making it easier to manage and debug.
*   **Usage:**
    1.  Install the library: `npm install @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/store-devtools`
    2.  Define your application's state, actions, and reducers.
    3.  Register the store and effects in your `app.module.ts`.
    4.  Use the `Store` service to dispatch actions and select data from the store.

### Chart.js

*   **Version:** 4.x (with ng2-charts 6.x)
*   **Explanation:** Chart.js is a popular charting library that allows you to create various types of charts, such as bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
*   **Usage:**
    1.  Install the libraries: `npm install chart.js ng2-charts`
    2.  Import the `NgChartsModule` in your `app.module.ts`.
    3.  Use the `baseChart` directive to create charts in your components.

### ApexCharts

*   **Version:** ngx-apexcharts (forked project)
*   **Explanation:** ApexCharts is another charting library that provides a wide range of interactive charts. As the official `ng-apexcharts` library does not yet support Angular 18, we will use a forked project that provides compatibility.
*   **Usage:**
    1.  Install the library: `npm install apexcharts ngx-apexcharts`
    2.  Import the `NgApexchartsModule` in your `app.module.ts`.
    3.  Use the `apx-chart` component to create charts in your components.

### @ckeditor/ckeditor5-angular

*   **Version:** 10.0.0 or newer
*   **Explanation:** CKEditor 5 is a modern rich text editor that can be easily integrated into your Angular application.
*   **Usage:**
    1.  Install the library: `npm install @ckeditor/ckeditor5-angular @ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic`
    2.  Import the `CKEditorModule` in your `app.module.ts`.
    3.  Use the `<ckeditor>` component in your templates to create the editor.
